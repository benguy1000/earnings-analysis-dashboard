      "text": "Thank you, Shelly, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we get to our record Q2 results, I want to take a moment to recognize our entire Pentair team. Your leadership has helped to elevate us to new levels of financial and operational execution in an extremely volatile environment. Now let's turn to the Q2 executive summary on Slide 8. We delivered a record quarter across all four metrics: sales, adjusted operating income, return on sales, and adjusted EPS in one of the most continuously challenging dynamic landscapes globally. In Q2, sales increased 2% and Pool grew 9%. Adjusted operating income increased 9%, ROS expanded by 170 basis points to 26.4%, and adjusted EPS rose 14% to $1.39. We also delivered record free cash flow and repurchased $75 million of shares in Q2. Driven by continued confidence in our ability to execute, we have increased our full-year '25 guidance. We now expect sales growth of approximately 1% to 2% and adjusted EPS to be approximately $4.75 to $4.85, up 11% at the midpoint versus full year 2024. In Q2, we made an incremental investment in an exciting new start-up known as HOPE Hydration, whose mission is to deliver free water through its digitally connected water refill hydro stations. At Pentair, we are continuously evolving to drive consistent long-term shareholder value. We have talked about our transformation initiatives and more recently, 80/20. At the same time, our teams are also focused on driving growth within their businesses and investing in strategic growth initiatives, including high-performing talent, new and breakthrough product innovations, go-to-market strategies, and digital transformation. Since the beginning of 2023, we have delivered over $200 million in transformation savings, net of investments, which includes the $44 million we drove in the first half of this year. We have committed to a total of $80 million in 2025, net of investments, and we see additional savings in 2026 to achieve our ROS target of 26% by 2026 year-end. We delivered a record quarter in Q2. We increased our full-year 2025 guidance due to increased confidence in our strategy. We continue to build a foundation of optimal operational efficiency that can be leveraged when volume returns to normal. We have a balanced water portfolio and a capital-light business model, with 75% of our businesses going through two-step distribution and roughly 75% of our revenue representing replacement sales.",

      "text": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 12. As John mentioned, we delivered a record quarter in sales, adjusted operating income, return on sales, and adjusted EPS in Q2 despite lower volume. We also drove record free cash flow. In Q2, we delivered sales of $1.1 billion, up 2%, adjusted operating income of $297 million, up 9%, ROS of 26.4%, which expanded 170 basis points, driven primarily by transformation and price, and adjusted EPS of $1.39, up 14%. Flow sales were flat year-over-year. Within Flow, residential sales were down 1% as higher interest rates continue to pressure residential end markets, but the rate of decline has improved considerably over the last two years. Commercial sales rose 1%, marking the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth. Industrial sales were flat, but a nice improvement versus the last few quarters. In Q2, Water Solutions sales declined 4% to $298 million, driven primarily by lower volume, which was partially offset by higher price. Commercial sales were down 3%, largely driven by softer end markets within foodservice. Within residential, sales were down 6% year-over-year, primarily due to a continued sluggish U.S. housing market and portfolio actions to improve the growth and profitability of the business. In Q2, Pool sales increased 9% to $427 million, driven by price, volume, and our Q4 2024 Gulfstream acquisition. Segment income was $153 million, up 14%, and return on sales increased 160 basis points to 35.7%, driven by price and transformation. We do expect price versus cost to normalize in Q3 as we incur a full quarter of tariffs. We generated record free cash flow of $596 million in Q2, up 14% year-over-year. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our return on invested capital surpassed 16%. Long term, we continue to target high teens ROIC. Our net debt leverage ratio was 1.2x, down from 1.6x a year ago. For the full year, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $4.75 to $4.85, which is up roughly 10% to 12% year-over-year. Also for the full year, we are increasing our sales guidance to up approximately 1% to 2% despite an approximate $40 million headwind relating to the sale of our commercial services business in Q2. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be approximately flat to up 1%. We expect Flow sales to be up approximately mid-single digits. We anticipate Water Solutions sales to be down approximately mid- to high single digits, with core sales approximately flat, including commercial water sales to be up approximately low to mid-single digits. Pool sales are expected to be up approximately 3% to 4%. We've updated our 2025 tariff impact to be approximately $75 million for the full year, which includes $15 million in Q2 and an estimated $60 million in the second half of 2025. This $75 million, which is included in our guidance compares to our previous estimate in Q1 of $140 million.",

So was that better-than-expected volume or more price? And then you raised pool for the year to up 6% to 7% versus, I think, up 4% to 5% where you were before. Where is the improvement coming from? Is it less assumed demand degradation? Any color between new pools, renovation break, and fix would be helpful.",

It's a lot higher than the $75 million of expected total tariff costs you have now. So are you forecasting rebating in the year, baking in some contingency for maybe new tariff costs that could come on August 1? How are you thinking about price versus cost in your guidance?",

We drove double-digit adjusted earnings growth, and Pool grew its top line 9% as a result of solid execution and transformation. We increased our 2025 sales and adjusted EPS outlook despite tariff impacts, and we remain confident in our long-term strategy.",
