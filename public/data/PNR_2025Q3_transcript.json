      "text": "In Q3, we delivered sales growth and a record third quarter across adjusted operating income, return on sales, and adjusted EPS. Sales increased 3% driven by our pool and flow segments. Adjusted operating income increased 10%. ROS expanded 160 basis points to 25.7%, and adjusted EPS rose 14% to $1.24. In September, we acquired HydroStop, a leading specialty valve solutions provider for water infrastructure, for approximately $292 million in cash, or $242 million net of the anticipated $50 million of tax benefits. This acquisition enhances our commercial flow business with a strong financial profile and strategic fit. Lastly, we are increasing our full-year guidance driven by a strong third quarter and continued confidence in our execution. We now expect sales growth of approximately 2% and adjusted EPS of approximately $4.85 to $4.90, up 12 to 13% from 2024. Over the last three years, our teams have successfully implemented our transformation initiative while continuing to drive strong execution leading to robust margin expansion. As we enter 2026, we feel confident that we've developed a flywheel that we expect will continue to drive efficiencies, opportunities, and profitability. We have delivered approximately $56 million in transformation savings year to date and are on track to reach approximately $80 million in 2025. I want to remind you that this performance is net of strategic growth investments and is in addition to the $174 million of net performance we drove in 2023 and 2024 combined. We delivered another quarter of sales growth and double-digit earnings growth due to strong execution. We increased our full-year 2025 guidance driven by a strong Q3 and continued confidence in our strategy. Before I hand the call over to Bob, I want to acknowledge that we announced this morning that Bob will be leaving Pentair effective 03/01/2026. And embarrass him a little by complimenting him on having been an outstanding partner to me and Pentair.",

      "text": "Thank you, John, for the very kind words. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Pentair, our partnership, and working with all the great people in the company. We have very strong finance and IT teams at Pentair, which is evidenced by Nick's and Heather's promotion. As John mentioned, we delivered a third-quarter record in adjusted operating income, return on sales, and adjusted EPS. In Q3, we drove sales of $1.022 billion, up 3%, adjusted operating income of $263 million, up 10%, ROS of 25.7%, an increase of 160 basis points, and adjusted EPS of $1.24, up 14%. Core sales were up 3% year over year, driven by core growth of 6% in pool, 4% in flow, and water solutions approximately flat. Moving to adjusted operating income, transformation was the primary driver of 160 basis points of margin expansion in Q3. Flow sales were up 6% year over year to $394 million. Within flow, residential sales were up 3%, commercial sales increased 5%, marking the thirteenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth, and industrial sales rose 10%. Segment income grew 15% and return on sales expanded 200 basis points to 24% driven by strong sales growth and transformation. In Q3, water solution sales declined 6% to $273 million. Core water solution sales were flat. Commercial sales were down 6%, inclusive of a 9% negative impact from the sale of commercial services in Q2. Residential sales were down 6% year over year primarily due to portfolio exits. In Q3, pool sales increased 7% to $354 million driven by price, volume, and the Q4 2024 Gulfstream acquisition. Segment income was $116 million, up 3%. Return on sales decreased 120 basis points to approximately 33%. As a reminder, in Q3 2024, ROS reflected margin expansion of nearly 500 basis points resulting in a challenging compare. We generated record free cash flow of $719 million year to date, up 14% year over year. Our balance sheet remains strong and our return on invested capital increased to 16.7% from 15.2% a year ago. Our net debt leverage ratio is 1.3 times, down from 1.4 times a year ago. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 3% to 4%. We expect flow sales to be up approximately high single digits, which includes our HydroStop acquisition of approximately $10 million of sales in the quarter at approximately 30% ROS. We're also introducing adjusted EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of approximately $1.11 to $1.16, up roughly 3% to 7%. We continue to execute well and are offsetting the impact of tariffs through increased prices and other mitigation strategies. Our total 2025 tariff impact of approximately $75 million remains consistent with our outlook in Q2, but tariff uncertainty continues.",
